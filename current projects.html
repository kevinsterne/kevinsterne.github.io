		<p><b>LeFawn Magazine issue 6</b></p>	
		
		LeFawn is a magazine of funny fiction, including corporate satire, McSweeny's Internet Tendency-style articles. Every issue is chocked full of fun psuedoscience and the ever-evolving narrative of the magazine's editor, Togna Bologna, and his attempts to rid himself of his angry past life, LeFawn. Issue 6 contains McSweeny's rejects, never-before-seen pieces, plenty of politcal satire and completely reworked pieces from the Shuga Records blog. Visit LeFawnMagazine Dot Com or email Togna Bologna at poopyfarts at yahoo Dot Com to submit!	</div>
