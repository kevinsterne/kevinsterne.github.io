		<p><b>LeFawn Magazine issue 6</b></p>	
		
<a href="http://lefawnmagazine.com/"target="_blank">LeFawn Magazine,</a> is a zine of fiction and art, including corporate satire, list pieces and immoral musings. Every issue is chocked full of fun psuedoscience and the ever-evolving narrative of the magazine's editor, Togna Bologna, and his attempts to rid himself of his angry past life, LeFawn. Issue 6 contains McSweeny's rejects, never-before-seen pieces, plenty of politcal satire and completely reworked pieces from the Shuga Records blog. Visit LeFawnMagazine dot com or electronically mail Togna Bologna at poopyfarts at yahoo dot com to submit!	</div>
